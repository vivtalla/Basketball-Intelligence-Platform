# CourtVue Labs

CourtVue Labs is a full-stack NBA analytics platform for player evaluation, team analysis, advanced metrics, and play-by-play insights. It is built for analysts and basketball enthusiasts who need rigorous, data-driven basketball context.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Recharts, SWR
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), async endpoints, Pydantic v2 for validation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary via SQLAlchemy 2.0), SQLite (`cache.db` — NBA API response cache only)
- **Data Sources**: `nba_api` (NBA.com Stats API), CSV imports for external metrics (LEBRON, RAPTOR, PIPM, EPM, RAPM)
- **Schema Management**: Alembic migrations (`backend/alembic/`) with `db/ensure_schema.py` retained only as a compatibility wrapper

---

## Architecture

```
backend/
  main.py                   → FastAPI app entry, CORS, router registration
  config.py                 → Env config (DB URL, cache TTLs, NBA API settings)
  routers/                  → Route handlers (players, stats, shotchart, leaderboards, teams, advanced, gamelogs)
  services/                 → Business logic (sync, PBP processing, advanced metrics)
  models/                   → Pydantic response schemas
  db/
    database.py             → SQLAlchemy engine & session factory (get_db dependency)
    models.py               → ORM models — see table below
    ensure_schema.py        → Compatibility wrapper for the Alembic migration path
    migrations.py           → Programmatic migration entry point (`python -m db.migrations`)
  data/
    nba_client.py           → NBA API wrapper (rate limiting, CacheManager, _cache_ttl_for_season)
    cache.py                → SQLite CacheManager (get/set/delete)
    pbp_import.py           → CLI: play-by-play data import
    epm_rapm_import.py      → CLI: external metric CSV import
    bulk_import.py          → CLI: bulk player/season data import

frontend/
  src/
    app/                    → Next.js pages (home, players/[id], leaderboards, compare, learn, teams, standings)
    components/             → React components (see component inventory below)
    hooks/                  → usePlayerStats, usePlayerSearch
    lib/
      api.ts                → All backend API calls (single source of truth)
      types.ts              → TypeScript interfaces mirroring backend Pydantic schemas
```

### ORM Models (`backend/db/models.py`)

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `Team` | `teams` | NBA team metadata |
| `Player` | `players` | Player profiles (NBA person_id as PK) |
| `SeasonStat` | `season_stats` | Season averages + advanced metrics per player/season/team |
| `TeamSeasonStat` | `team_season_stats` | Canonical official team dashboard season stats |
| `TeamSplitStat` | `team_split_stats` | Canonical official team general split stats |
| `PlayerGameLog` | `player_game_logs` | Per-game stats, persisted to avoid repeat API calls |
| `GameLog` | `game_logs` | Game metadata (date, teams, score) — PBP parent |
| `PlayByPlay` | `play_by_play` | Individual PBP events |
| `PlayerOnOff` | `player_on_off` | On/off splits derived from PBP stints |
| `LineupStats` | `lineup_stats` | 5-man lineup ratings derived from PBP |

## Commands

### Development

```bash
# Backend — run from backend/
uvicorn main:app --reload                    # FastAPI dev server :8000

# Frontend — run from frontend/
npm run dev                                  # Next.js dev server :3000
npm run build                                # Production build
npm run lint                                 # ESLint
```

### Schema Updates

```bash
# Run from backend/ — canonical schema upgrade path
python -m db.migrations
```

> **Note:** Schema evolution is migration-driven. `python -m db.ensure_schema` still works as a compatibility alias, but new schema work should land as Alembic revisions.

### Data Import

```bash
# Play-by-play sync — run from backend/
python data/pbp_import.py --season 2024-25
python data/pbp_import.py --season 2024-25 --player-id 123456 --force-refresh

# External metrics CSV import — run from backend/
python data/epm_rapm_import.py data.csv --metrics epm,rapm
python data/epm_rapm_import.py data.csv --metrics lebron,raptor,pipm

# Bulk import — run from backend/
python data/bulk_import.py --season 2024-25
```

Cron: `0 6 * * * /path/to/backend/data/daily_sync.sh`

### Re-Sync PBP Stats

```bash
POST /api/advanced/sync-season   body: {"season": "2024-25"}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://localhost/bip` | PostgreSQL connection |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000` | Allowed frontend origins |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Backend URL for frontend |

---

## Data Conventions

- Stats stored as per-100-possessions or per-36-minute rates with raw totals alongside. Never raw totals without context.
- Player IDs: NBA.com `person_id` as canonical identifier. Names are NOT unique.
- Season format: always `"2024-25"` string — never `2024` or `2025` alone.
- Game dates: ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`), stored as `date` type.
- All timestamps UTC. Convert to local only at display layer.
- Always surface sample size with any rate stat. Flag stats with <200 possessions or <20 games.

---

## Analytics Domain Rules

- Cross-era player comparisons must adjust for pace and league-average efficiency of that season.
- Lineup data requires ≥100 possessions together to be reportable.
- Offensive and defensive ratings use opponent-adjusted values for cross-team comparison.
- Clutch = last 5 minutes, score within 5 points.
- On/off splits come from PBP stint data, not box scores. Stint minutes measured from clock timestamps.
- External metrics (LEBRON, RAPTOR, EPM, PIPM, RAPM) are imported. Never present as platform-original. Always attribute source.
- Possession counting: FGA + TOV + last-FT-in-sequence (excluding and-ones and technical FTs).

---

## Code Style

- Python: type hints on all function signatures. Use `Annotated` types for FastAPI dependencies.
- Python version is **3.8** — use `Optional[X]` / `List[X]` from `typing`, not `X | None` / `list[X]`.
- TypeScript: strict mode, no `any`. Prefer `unknown` + type narrowing.
- API responses always use Pydantic schemas — never return raw dicts or ORM objects.
- Database queries go through the service layer, never directly in route handlers.
- Frontend data fetching uses SWR hooks — never raw `fetch` in components.
- React hooks must be pre-allocated at the top level (no conditional hooks). For compound filters with dynamic slot counts, allocate a fixed maximum number of hook slots.

---

## Caching Strategy

| Data | Storage | TTL |
|------|---------|-----|
| Game logs (per player/season) | PostgreSQL `player_game_logs` | Historical: never re-fetch. Current season: 24h. |
| Shot chart data | SQLite `cache.db` | Historical: 30 days. Current season: 6h. |
| Season/team game IDs | SQLite `cache.db` | Same TTL rules via `_cache_ttl_for_season()` |
| PBP events | PostgreSQL `play_by_play` | Fetched once per game, never re-fetched |

`_cache_ttl_for_season(season)` in `nba_client.py` returns `CURRENT_SEASON_CACHE_TTL` if `season == _active_nba_season()`, else `HISTORICAL_SEASON_CACHE_TTL`.

---

## Gotchas

- **Read `AGENTS.md` at session start before touching any code.** It contains the current sprint scope, your branch, this sprint's work allocation, the shared file Lock Table, and the Handoff Queue.
- **nba_api rate limits aggressively** — `nba_client.py` enforces 0.6s delays. Never call `nba_api` directly outside this wrapper.
- **Player names are not unique.** Multiple players share names (e.g., Marcus Morris Sr./Jr.). Always resolve to `person_id`.
- **The salary cap changes every season.** Never hardcode cap numbers.
- **External metrics are proprietary.** RAPTOR, EPM, LEBRON, etc. are imported. Always attribute source.
- **SQLite `cache.db` is for NBA API response caching only** — PostgreSQL is the primary datastore.
- **Schema changes are migration-driven.** Use Alembic revisions and `python -m db.migrations`; do not rely on app-startup DDL.
- **Python 3.8.** No union type syntax (`X | Y`), no `list[X]` subscripting at runtime in type hints.
- **Do not add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer to git commits.** Commits must not credit Claude. Omit the `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` footer on PRs as well.

---

## Core Principles

- **Data integrity over speed**: Never ship a pipeline without output schema validation.
- **Context is everything**: A stat without context (sample size, opponent adjustment, era normalization) is misleading.
- **Simplicity first**: Make every change as simple as possible and minimize code impact.
- **Only touch what's necessary**: Don't refactor adjacent code while fixing a bug. Scope changes tightly.
- **No laziness**: Find root causes. Avoid temporary fixes. Maintain senior-level engineering standards.

---

## Agent Behaviors

### Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for any task with 3+ steps or an architectural decision.
- If something goes wrong mid-execution, stop and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing.
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building.
- Write a detailed spec upfront to reduce ambiguity before any code is written.

### Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents frequently to keep the main context window clean.
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents.
- For complex problems, throw more compute via subagents rather than reasoning linearly.
- One task per subagent — focused execution, not omnibus prompts.

### Self-Improvement Loop
- After any correction from the user, update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern as a rule.
- Write the lesson as a rule, not a narrative, to prevent repeating the same mistake.
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at the start of each session.
- Iterate ruthlessly until the mistake rate drops.

### Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works.
- Diff behavior between `master` and your changes when relevant.
- Ask: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, and demonstrate correctness before declaring done.

### Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes, ask: "Is there a more elegant solution?"
- If a fix feels hacky, ask: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution."
- Skip this for simple fixes — don't over-engineer straightforward changes.
- Challenge your own work before presenting it to the user.

### Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report, fix it — don't ask for re-explanation of what's broken.
- Use logs, error messages, and failing tests to diagnose root cause.
- Require zero context-switching from the user.
- Fix failing CI/lint tests automatically when encountered.

## Task Management

Convention:
```
tasks/
  todo.md      → per-session work plan (transient — create at session start when needed)
  lessons.md   → self-improvement log (persistent — never reset)
```

Workflow:
1. **Plan First** — write the plan in `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items.
2. **Verify Plan** — confirm the plan before any implementation begins.
3. **Track Progress** — mark items complete as you go; don't batch-check at the end.
4. **Explain Changes** — provide a high-level summary at each step.
5. **Document Results** — add a review section to `tasks/todo.md` when done.
6. **Capture Lessons** — update `tasks/lessons.md` after any correction.

---

## Sprint Process

CourtVue Labs uses a hybrid sprint model: major feature sprints typically run as two parallel teams, while small or tightly coupled sprints use one sequential `Architect → Engineer → Reviewer → Optimizer` stream. Branch/worktree cleanup is part of the default operating model.

## Recent Sprints

> Full history → `specs/sprint-history.md`

### Sprint 66 — Staff Packet And Coaching Handoff

- Upgraded `pre_read_snapshots` into named staff packets with Alembic revision `0010_pre_read_packet_metadata`, adding editable packet metadata (`title`, `note`) while keeping frozen saved payloads stable.
- Extended Pre-Read snapshot contracts and services with packet selection summaries, frozen scouting-claim persistence, inline packet metadata updates, and markdown export from saved snapshots.
- Rebuilt `/pre-read` around a real packet workflow: packet library tabs (`This Matchup`, `Team History`), inline rename/note editing, scouting-packet rendering, and packet-level `Open` / `Copy share link` / `Export markdown` actions.
- Added ScoutingReportView packet pinning so analysts can carry up to 3 claims with confidence pills and ranked clip anchors directly into the saved staff packet.
- Verified with new Sprint 66 backend coverage, full backend `pytest` (196 passing), frontend `npm run build`, frontend `npm run lint` with only pre-existing warnings, and a live manual smoke walkthrough after migrating the local dev Postgres schema.

### Sprint 65 — Scouting & Opportunity Fit

- Added in-process TTL cache on `build_opportunity_report` keyed by `(season, team, min_minutes, position, date)` so `team=ALL` scouting traversals no longer recompute per call; 10 min current-season, 24 h historical.
- Pre-computed `OpportunityCompareHandoff` on every top-row (pinned + top 3 same-bucket peers drawn from the full pool); RoleFitCard ships a `Compare with peers →` CTA that threads `source=opportunity` + cohort into the Compare URL.
- Extended `OpportunityRoleFit` with AST/G and TOV/G vs cohort (delta column), and locked the directional-hint gate to `confidence ∈ {high, medium}` AND `len(hint_basis) ≥ 2` with no orphan chips.
- New `ClaimInferenceConfidence` on every scouting claim (level + reasons + anchored/opponent-specific counts); `_rank_claims_by_confidence` promotes opponent-backed high-confidence claims in each section; `ScoutingClipAnchor.opponent_specific` flag populated.
- ScoutingReportView renders a calibrated confidence pill per claim + `Compare with this claim →` link; Compare and Pre-Read render inbound-context banners for `source=opportunity` / `source=scouting`.
- Renamed `UsageEfficiencyDashboard.tsx` → `OpportunityDashboard.tsx`, deleted three stale pre-Sprint-58 files, removed the orphan `UsageEfficiencyPlayerRow` type.
- Bugfix: `_position_bucket` now handles compound NBA positions (`Guard-Forward`, `Forward-Center`, `SG/SF`) via primary-token split + full-word map; Jaylen Brown no longer collapses to bucket `other`.
- Bonus: relaxed Recharts Tooltip formatter value type in `TeamNetRatingChart` so `npm run build` type-check passes (regression from Sprint 64).
- Verified with 14 new backend tests (193 passing), frontend `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build` clean, and live dev-server exercise against `/insights?tab=usage&team=BOS` + `/pre-read?team=OKC&opponent=BOS&mode=scouting`.

*Sprint 64 and older moved to `specs/sprint-history.md`.*
